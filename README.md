# INSTA-LOVE-BUTTON


This project is a simple web application that adds an interactive "like" or "love" effect to an image when the user double-clicks on it. The project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create this visual effect.

## Project Components

The project consists of the following components:

1. **HTML (`index.html`):**
   - The HTML file defines the basic structure of the web page.
   - It includes an image of a model and an icon that represents a heart.

2. **CSS (`style.css`):**
   - The CSS file contains styles to format and position the elements on the page.
   - It sets the initial state of the heart icon to be hidden and scale it down.

3. **JavaScript (`script.js`):**
   - The JavaScript file adds interactivity to the project.
   - It listens for a double-click event on the container element (`#container`).
   - When the user double-clicks the container, it triggers an animation:
     - The heart icon scales up and becomes partially visible.
     - After a short delay, the heart fades out.
     - Finally, the heart icon scales down and disappears completely.

## Features

- **Double-Click Interaction:** Users can double-click on the container to activate the love effect.
- **Visual Feedback:** The heart icon scales up and fades in to provide visual feedback to the user.
- **Animation:** The animation creates an engaging and appealing interaction.

This project can serve as a fun addition to websites, especially those focused on sharing content or social interactions. Users can double-click on images to express their appreciation, similar to a "like" button in social media applications.
